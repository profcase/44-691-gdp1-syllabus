    <h2>Course Description </h2>
    Software development practicum designed to integrate computer-related skills into an intensive project environment. Students
    enroll in this course for two consecutive semesters, for a total of six credit hours. This is the first of the two courses.

    <h2>Course Rationale</h2>
    This course provides a chance for students to practice the skills developed in earlier courses and further develop their
    skills using profession-based learning. Students gain experience with designing, developing, testing, and managing real
    world projects using modern tools and techniques.

    <h2>Late Work Policy </h2>
    Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. Late work is not accepted and may result in a 0 for the assignment.
    If you must miss an activity or a deadline, contact the instructor in advance.

    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    All submissions must be unique and creative. All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. Students may be asked
    to explain their work during class, in discussions, or in a recorded submission.

    <h2> Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>
    Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades may only be given in extreme circumstances, such
    as illness, death in a student 's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's control, and the student
    was unable to complete a significant portion of the course work.

    <h2>Attendance </h2>
    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course syllabi for each course. This course has many in-class
    activities, most of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or missing activities
    due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up work and may earn zero points for the activity. It is the responsibility
    of the student to promptly notify their instructor when unable to attend class. Please refer to the university policy
    on attendance at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf">https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf</a>

    <h2>Excused Absences </h2>
    Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event (documented with an excuse signed by the university sponsor
    prior to the event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course instructor. A student may make up class
    work without penalty for excused absences.

    <h2>Final Exams</h2>
    If an emergency occurs that prevents the administration of a course scheduled final examination, the final course grades
    will be calculated based on the work in the course completed to that point in time and the faculty member’s considered
    judgment. Final exams will not be rescheduled, and a grade of “I” will not be given as a result of an institutional cancellation
    of a final examination.

    <h2>Administrative Drop </h2>
